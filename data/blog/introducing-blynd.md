summary: Introducing Blynd - a new way to order food online
---

Blynd takes the decision fatigue out of deciding what to order. Restaurants serve one dish at a time. It is unknown to customers and can change at any time. Customers order ahead and arrive at the serving time to pick up their meal.

We will be launching soon. Request and upvote the restaurants you want to see on the platform [here](https://eatblynd.com). If the restaurant you request joins the platform, your first meal is on us!

Blynd special NFT recipe. Chef can document process. Owner/admirer could make the meal
